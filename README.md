When creating a pull request, keep in mind that you'll also have to update the padoru.json file.
This can be done either manually or by using my Padoru- Manager (repo on my profile). 
The Preferred method is creating a Image Suggestion.

Also, providing high resolution images with transparent background is highly encouraged, but not a requirement.

## Disclaimer
* I do not own any of these Images, I just bring them together into one collection. Read the entry below if you want a image to be removed
* It may not be OK to use some, if not all, of these Images in a Commercial way. So use for Private use ONLY
* Information in this Repository is provided as-is (= without any guarantee that it is correct)
* I may edit source images before adding them to the collection (upscaling, transparent background, ...).
	* I do **not** remove watermarks *(I try, but since I use batch processing to remove the background, I might miss one or the other image where the watermark was removed)*

## A Image I Created Is Listed In This Collection, But I'm Not Named As Creator
Images in this repository are collected from the internet. Tracking each image back to the original author is (almost) impossible. 
If you want to be mentioned as creator of a image, please contact me by [opening a Issue](https://github.com/shadow578/Project-Padoru/issues/new?assignees=&labels=change&template=change-request.md&title=%5BCHANGE%5D) stating 
* The affected Image(s)
* The Name you want to be used as Creator Name
* (If possible) a link to the original post of the image
I'll then change the Creator information as soon as I can.

## A Image I Created Is In This Collection And I Dont Like That
Thats sad to hear. If you want your Image to be remove, please contact me by [opening a Issue](https://github.com/shadow578/Project-Padoru/issues/new?assignees=&labels=remove&template=removal-request.md&title=%5BREMOVAL%5D) and I'll remove the Image as soon as I can.

Please keep in mind that removing the Image may take some time.
